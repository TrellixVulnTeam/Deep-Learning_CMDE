Goal: predict historical gold price from 1970, jan - 2017, july


x:
1) fed fund rate (https://www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload/Choose.aspx?rel=H15)
2) dows (https://www.quandl.com/data/BCB/UDJIAD1-Dow-Jones-Industrial-Average; http://quotes.wsj.com/index/DJIA/advanced-chart)
3) vix
4) gdp growth
5) oil price
6) inflation (http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/historical-inflation-rates/)

y:
gold price (https://www.quandl.com/data/LBMA/GOLD-Gold-Price-London-Fixing)


questions:

1) how to make data depends on time?
2) how to deal with partial data? (some data can't be traced back to 1970)
3) how to deal with coarse data (some data is avaiable month-by-month only, whereas some is available in daily basis)



next step:

normalize Y?




simpler model?
more data?
